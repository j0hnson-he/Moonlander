# Moonlander
This program is a lunar landing simulator. It retrieves initial user fuel amount and altitude as the baseline. It then asks for user fuel rate until the altitude reaches 0 and determines if it is a safe landing or not.

To run this program:
```
python3 moonlander.py
```

If you don't have version 3 of python, you can download it here: https://www.python.org/downloads/
